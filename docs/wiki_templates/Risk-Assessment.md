## Team Risks (TR)

| # | Description / Impact | Prob (%) | Impact | Risk Code | Mitigation Plan / Contingency Plan | Status |
|---|---------------------|----------|--------|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|
| 1 | **Limited Availability:** Team members have exams or part-time jobs (e.g., Intel), causing delays in development sprints | 80% | H | TR-01 | **Mitigation:** Plan "light" sprints during exam weeks; Use Agile board to visualize bottlenecks early | Active |
| 2 | **Uneven Workload:** One or two members carry the majority of the coding load, leading to burnout and quality issues | 50% | M | TR-03 | **Mitigation:** Assign tasks clearly in Jira/Trello; Rotate complex tasks so everyone learns the codebase | Active |
| 3 | **Skill Gaps:** Some team members lack experience with required technologies (React, Node.js, MongoDB, etc.) | 60% | M | TR-04 | **Mitigation:** Pair programming sessions; Knowledge sharing workshops; Assign learning tasks early | Active |
| 4 | **Dropout / Emergency:** A team member leaves the course or has a personal emergency, reducing workforce | 10% | VH | TR-05 | **Contingency:** Immediately schedule a meeting with the course supervisor. Present the Time Log to prove the loss of workforce and formally request a **reduction in project scope** (e.g., removing 2 features) without a grade penalty | Monitoring |
| 5 | **Team Conflicts:** Disagreements on technical decisions or responsibilities causing delays | 25% | M | TR-06 | **Mitigation:** Establish clear roles; Use voting for decisions; Escalate to course instructor if needed | Monitoring |
| 6 | **Git Merge Conflicts:** Multiple members edit the same files simultaneously, leading to lost code or difficult merges | 60% | H | TR-08 | **Mitigation:** Divide tasks by distinct components/files; Pull changes before starting work every day | Monitoring |
| 7 | **Unclear Task Ownership:** Nobody takes responsibility for certain tasks, causing delays | 35% | M | TR-09 | **Mitigation:** Assign explicit owner for each task; Review assignments in sprint planning | Active |

## Monitoring & Review

- **Weekly** review of high-risk items  
- **Monthly** review of medium-risk items  
- **Immediate** review upon incident occurrence
